            ### How to Use This Calculator
            
            **Basic Usage:**
            - Enter mathematical expressions in the input field
            - Click "Calculate" or press Enter to compute the result
            - The result will appear below the input
            
            **Supported Operations:**
            - Addition: `+` (e.g., `5 + 3`)
            - Subtraction: `-` (e.g., `10 - 4`)
            - Multiplication: `*` (e.g., `6 * 7`)
            - Division: `/` (e.g., `15 / 3`)
            - Exponentiation: `**` (e.g., `2**3` for 2¬≥)
            - Parentheses: `()` for grouping (e.g., `(5 + 3) * 2`)
            
            **Scoring Examples:**
            - Calculate word score: `3 + 1 + 2 + 5` (for "CARD")
            - Add bonuses: `word_total + 10` (longest word bonus)
            - Round total: `(word1 + word2 + word3) + bonuses`

            ### Basic Gameplay
            
            **Each Turn:**
            1. Draw a card (from deck or discard pile)
            2. Arrange cards into words
            3. Discard one card to end turn
            
            **Going Out:**
            - Use ALL cards in your hand to make words (except one to discard)
            - Can only go out on your turn
            - Once someone goes out, others get one final turn
            
            **Word Rules:**
            - Minimum 2 cards per word
            - No proper nouns, prefixes, suffixes, abbreviations, or hyphenated words
            - Choose your dictionary before starting
            - Words can be challenged if questionable

            **Basic Scoring:**
            - Cards used in words = Points FOR you
            - Unused cards = Points AGAINST you
            - Minimum score per round is 0 (can't go negative)
            
            **Bonuses (10 points each):**
            - **Most Words:** Player with most words in the round
            - **Longest Word:** Player with word using most letters
            - Same player can win both bonuses
            - No bonus awarded if there's a tie
            - *Note: With 2 players, use only one bonus*
            
            **Final Score:** Highest total after 10 rounds wins

            ### Word Challenges
            
            **Challenge Process:**
            - Any player can challenge a word after it's played
            - Check dictionary to resolve
            - **If word is valid:** Challenger loses points equal to word value
            - **If word is invalid:** Player loses points equal to word value
            
            ### Strategy Tips
            
            **Word Strategy:**
            - Early rounds: Focus on using all cards
            - Later rounds: Consider longer words vs. more words
            - Watch for bonus opportunities (most words/longest word)
            
            **Scoring Strategy:**
            - High-value letters (Q, Z, X, J) are worth big points but risky
            - Consider keeping common letters for easier word formation
            - Balance between going out first vs. maximizing points
